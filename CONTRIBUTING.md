# Contributing

*You cannot contribute to this projects orginal files!*

You can contribute into the, "Community" Folder where you can put a folder with your python files inside with an .md file detailing
the improvements that you have made and how you have done those improvements to help me and others to understand what you have done.

Anything that violates the community guidelines will be taken off and will result in a permanent ban from this project. Anything else
unrelated to the main project is not acceptable either.
